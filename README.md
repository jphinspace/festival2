# festival2
Festival simulation using HTML5 canvas and agent-based modeling

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to run the simulation.

## Features

- **Agent-Based Simulation**: 50 fan agents represented as colored dots
- **Frame-Independent Movement**: Smooth movement regardless of frame rate
- **Adjustable Speed**: Use the slider to adjust simulation speed from 0.1x to 5.0x (100-5000 ticks/s)
- **Physics**: Agents bounce off the boundaries of the festival grounds

## Current Implementation

- Initial version focuses on fan agents only
- Agents move randomly around the festival grounds
- All movement is frame-independent for consistent behavior
